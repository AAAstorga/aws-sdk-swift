The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that the default Lambda rotation function knows how to parse. For storing multiple values, we recommend that you use a JSON text string argument and specify key/value pairs. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example:  [{"username":"bob"},{"password":"abc123xyz456"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. You can also 'escape' the double quote character in the embedded JSON text by prefacing each with a backslash. For example, the following string is surrounded by double-quotes. All of the embedded double quotes are escaped:  "[{\"username\":\"bob\"},{\"password\":\"abc123xyz456\"}]"

If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions and include that value in the request. You typically only need to interact with this value if you implement your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not created twice. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.  Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the Lambda rotation function's processing.   If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from the request then an error occurs because you cannot modify an existing secret value.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

        /// (Optional) Specifies a list of user-defined tags that are attached to the secret. Each tag is a "Key" and "Value" pair of strings. This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use UntagResource.    Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".   If you check tags in IAM policy Condition elements as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.    This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example:  [{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per secretâ€”50   Maximum key lengthâ€”127 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value lengthâ€”255 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.   If your tagging schema will be used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.

Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console.

The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes that in the request for this parameter. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions and include that value in the request. You only need to specify your own value if you are implementing your own retry logic and want to ensure that a given secret is not created twice. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.  Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during the function's processing.
