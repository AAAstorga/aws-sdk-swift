The request stays in this state until all recipients respond.    OPEN: This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.    CANCELED: This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.    ACCEPTED: This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.    DECLINED: This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.    EXPIRED: This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).
