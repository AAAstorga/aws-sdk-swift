RollingBack: Endpoint fails to scale up or down or change its variant weight and is in the process of rolling back to its previous configuration. Once the rollback completes, endpoint returns to an InService status. This transitional status only applies to an endpoint that has autoscaling enabled and is undergoing variant weight or capacity changes as part of an UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities call or when the UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities operation is called explicitly.    InService: Endpoint is available to process incoming requests.    Deleting: DeleteEndpoint is executing.    Failed: Endpoint could not be created, updated, or re-scaled. Use DescribeEndpointOutput$FailureReason for information about the failure. DeleteEndpoint is the only operation that can be performed on a failed endpoint.   To get a list of endpoints with a specified status, use the ListEndpointsInput$StatusEquals filter.

If an algorithm supports the Pipe input mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to the container.

In addition to the training data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container use ML storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.
