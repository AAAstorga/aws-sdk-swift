For all tests:   app_performance_monitoring: Performance monitoring is enabled by default. Set this parameter to "false" to disable it.   For Calabash tests:   profile: A cucumber profile, for example, "my_profile_name".   tags: You can limit execution to features or scenarios that have (or don't have) certain tags, for example, "@smoke" or "@smoke,~@wip".   For Appium tests (all types):   appium_version: The Appium version. Currently supported values are "1.7.2", "1.7.1", "1.6.5", "latest", and "default".   “latest” will run the latest Appium version supported by Device Farm (1.7.2).   For “default”, Device Farm will choose a compatible version of Appium for the device. The current behavior is to run 1.7.2 on Android devices and iOS 9 and earlier, 1.7.2 for iOS 10 and later.   This behavior is subject to change.     For Fuzz tests (Android only):   event_count: The number of events, between 1 and 10000, that the UI fuzz test should perform.   throttle: The time, in ms, between 0 and 1000, that the UI fuzz test should wait between events.   seed: A seed to use for randomizing the UI fuzz test. Using the same seed value between tests ensures identical event sequences.   For Explorer tests:   username: A username to use if the Explorer encounters a login form. If not supplied, no username will be inserted.   password: A password to use if the Explorer encounters a login form. If not supplied, no password will be inserted.   For Instrumentation:   filter: A test filter string. Examples:   Running a single test case: "com.android.abc.Test1"   Running a single test: "com.android.abc.Test1#smoke"   Running multiple tests: "com.android.abc.Test1,com.android.abc.Test2"     For XCTest and XCTestUI:   filter: A test filter string. Examples:   Running a single test class: "LoginTests"   Running a multiple test classes: "LoginTests,SmokeTests"   Running a single test: "LoginTests/testValid"   Running multiple tests: "LoginTests/testValid,LoginTests/testInvalid"     For UIAutomator:   filter: A test filter string. Examples:   Running a single test case: "com.android.abc.Test1"   Running a single test: "com.android.abc.Test1#smoke"   Running multiple tests: "com.android.abc.Test1,com.android.abc.Test2"
