If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.

If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047.

For a list on unsupported content types, see Unsupported Attachment Types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   The entire message must be base64-encoded.   If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend that you encode that content. For more information, see Sending Raw Email in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   Per RFC 5321, the maximum length of each line of text, including the &lt;CRLF&gt;, must not exceed 1,000 characters.

For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.  If you specify the Source parameter and have feedback forwarding enabled, then bounces and complaints will be sent to this email address. This takes precedence over any Return-Path header that you might include in the raw text of the message.

For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses. If you use the default master key, you don't need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.   To use a custom master key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your key's policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   For more information about key policies, see the AWS KMS Developer Guide.

For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide.  Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in RFC6531. For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters. If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492. The sender name (also known as the friendly name) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described inRFC 2047. MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?=.
