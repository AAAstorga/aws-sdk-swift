For more information about linking Docker containers, go to https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/. This parameter maps to Links in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --link option to  docker run .  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.   Containers that are collocated on a single container instance may be able to communicate with each other without requiring links or host port mappings.

        /// The number of cpu units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run. This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances detail page by 1,024.  For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see CPU share constraint in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:    Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.    Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that is described in the task definition.

Port mappings on Windows use the NetNAT gateway address rather than localhost. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself.  This parameter maps to PortBindings in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to none, then you can't specify port mappings.

However the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition.

To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'   This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.

Other repositories are specified with either  repository-url/image:tag  or  repository-url/image@digest . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of docker run.   When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use. However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks.   Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full registry/repository:tag or registry/repository@digest. For example, 012345678910.dkr.ecr.&lt;region-name&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;:latest or 012345678910.dkr.ecr.&lt;region-name&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE.    Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ubuntu or mongo).   Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent).   Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu).

The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register with the ECS_SELINUX_CAPABLE=true or ECS_APPARMOR_CAPABLE=true environment variables before containers placed on that instance can use these security options.

If the service is using the ECS deployment controller, you are limited to one load balancer or target group. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here. For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, in which case you should not specify a role here. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
