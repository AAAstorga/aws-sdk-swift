The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z). CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:   Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.   If you set Period to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15. 
        public let startTime: TimeStamp

High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second. If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:   Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).
