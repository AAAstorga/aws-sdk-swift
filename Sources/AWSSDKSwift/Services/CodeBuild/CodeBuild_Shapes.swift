One way to do this is to initialize the Docker daemon during the install phase of your build spec by running the following build commands. (Do not run these commands if the specified build environment image is provided by AWS CodeBuild with Docker support.) If the operating system's base image is Ubuntu Linux:  - nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&amp; - timeout 15 sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"  If the operating system's base image is Alpine Linux, add the -t argument to timeout:  - nohup /usr/local/bin/dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock --host=tcp://0.0.0.0:2375 --storage-driver=overlay&amp; - timeout 15 -t sh -c "until docker info; do echo .; sleep 1; done"
