The intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. For example, an alarm triggers a step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon ECS service by 2 tasks, the scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown period of 5 minutes starts. During the Cooldown period, if the alarm triggers the same policy again but at a more aggressive step adjustment to scale out the service by 3 tasks, the 2 tasks that were added in the previous scale out event are considered part of that capacity and only 1 additional task is added to the desired count. For scale in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale in requests until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively to protect your application's availability.
