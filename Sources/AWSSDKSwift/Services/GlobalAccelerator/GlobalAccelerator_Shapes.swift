AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection. If client affinity is NONE, Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—client IP address, client port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.  If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to CLIENT_IP instead. When you use the CLIENT_IP setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— client IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value. For UDP, Global Accelerator always uses two-tuple properties to select the hash value. The default value is NONE.
